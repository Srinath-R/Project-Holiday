# Project-Holiday 
A robust Leave Management System

<p>
We plan to build a software for facilitating the process of applying and approving leave based
applications. We propose to design the system in a manner that it can be used both by
educational and corporate organizations to a great extent. The necessity of this kind of a
system comes into light when we closely observe the latency that is involved in the current
methods being followed for handling leave applications. Making the entire process digital not
only does away with the latency but also gives us access to a lot of crucial analytical
information which can be used to efficiently plan events, meetings and keep track of the overall
productivity levels of your students/employees.

## Key Modules and Functionalities:

### User Onboarding
The first module is for the users to gain access to the application by using the
registration submodule for new users or the log-in submodule for existing users.
Using this module, new users can join the system once they have been verified for
authenticity by the administrator. For existing users they can simply login or choose to
stay logged in, and can move on to the leave application module.

### User Dashboard
The User dashboard module comes in two different variants for two different categories
of users, the ones with rights to approve an applicant’s leave application and the ones
without those rights. Assuming a University based setup, the students on their
dashboard can see their profile details etc. whereas the faculties can see their profile
along with a short analysis of their respective class or other faculties for whom he/she
has leave approval rights, on their dashboard.

### Leave Application module
This is a crucial module as it is through this module with which the users can avail the
following functionalities of our application:<br/>
❏ Apply for a leave.<br/>
❏ Check the status of your leave application.<br/>
❏ Delete an existing leave request.<br/>
❏ Approve leave application requests for students / lower-level employees.

### Analytics and Calendar
This module brings out the adjunct advantages of this software and bolsters the idea of
why we should make the entire leave application system digital. Using this module, the
users such as students in a university system setup, can keep track of all their
upcoming on-duty leaves or ordinary leaves and inform their corresponding faculties in
advance. The faculties will have an option to view crucial information such as maximum
possible attendance in an upcoming class based on the number of students who had
applied for leaves or s and pre-plan their agenda for the class, this option becomes very
useful in times of major events in universities where usually a large number of students
go on OD’s, therefore with prior information about estimated student presence,
faculties can well plan their classes and impending tests.

### Final Report
Faculties or admins can generate a weekly or monthly or yearly report for specific
individuals or entire groups to get crucial insights regarding the performance levels of
these groups etc.
